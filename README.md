# samcoster_talon notes
*This is a series of talon-related commands for controlling a variety of gamedev related programs with voice. I've included short commentary here for each .talon file and what it's intending to do, so you can easily find what you're looking for.*


# _globals: Global Hotkey for toggling talon 
ctrl+alt+space will cause Talon to begin listening, or stop listening. Very handy for when you're hopping into/out of voice calls while using talon, such that you don't have to say "TALON WAKE/SLEEP" like a maniac every 30s.

# _github: For github desktop
Context-specific to the github desktop application, using its native hotkeys.
"git push" - causes you to push your current commits.
"git pull" - causes you to fetch and pull.

# _sharex: For taking your screenshots and uploading them to imgur automagically
Requires that you've setup sharex, and changed its hotkey for screenshotting to ctrl+home
"share ex" - causes a full-screen capture editor to take a screenshot

# _gamemaker: For Gamemaker Studio
Context-specific to Gamemaker Studio application, using its native hotkeys
"game play" - Starts the game
"clean" - clears the game's cache

# _csp: Custom commands for a highly customized Clip Studio Paint
Context-specific to Clip Studio Paint, using a highly specialized mass of hotkeys that span built-in system hotkeys as well as custom macro hotkeys. Full usage requires download and installation of Sam's CSP hotkey profile (not yet available)
